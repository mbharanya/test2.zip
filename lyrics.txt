Verse 1:

A stegosaurus rises, celebrating with great mirth.
Underneath the fiery skies, his plates glisten in the light,
He roars a mighty anthem, as day turns into night.

For the mighty stegosaurus, whose birthday now is here.

With your strength, we carry on.
On your birthday, we sing with pride,
Through the ages, side by side.

He strides with pride and glory, his legacy to show.
With each thunderous footstep, the earth reverberates,
In a symphony of power, his heart reveres and celebrates.

On this day of celebration, we unite in joy and cheer,
For the mighty stegosaurus, whose birthday now is here.
